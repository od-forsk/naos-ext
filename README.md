NAOS Extension to manage your **NAOS** deployments directly from Visual Studio Code.

NAOS (Network as a Service) is a platform for Radio Access Network (RAN) management and network optimization. This extension provides a comprehensive interface for managing services, users, teams, instances, projects, workspaces, jobs, geofiles, coverages, and artifacts within your NAOS environment.

## Installation

### From Visual Studio Code Marketplace

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "NAOS"
4. Click "Install" on the NAOS extension by forsk-sas

## Usage

### Working with NAOS Files

The extension supports various NAOS file types with JSON validation and snippets:

1. **Create a new NAOS file**: Create a file with the pattern `*.{type}.naos` where `{type}` can be:
   - `user.naos` - User definitions
   - `team.naos` - Team configurations
   - `instance.naos` - NAOS instance settings
   - `job.naos` - Job definitions
   - `project.naos` - Project configurations
   - `workspace.naos` - Workspace settings
   - `geofile.naos` - Geographical data files
   - `coverage.naos` - Coverage data

2. **Use snippets**: In any `.naos` file, start typing the resource type (e.g., "user", "team") and use IntelliSense (Ctrl+Space) to insert templates

3. **Validate and edit**: The extension provides real-time validation, auto-completion, and hover documentation

4. **Publish changes**: Use the cloud upload button in the editor title or run the "NAOS: POST or PUT to NAOS" command to apply changes

### Managing Resources

#### Users
- Add new users via the "+" button in the Users view
- Generate JWT tokens for authentication
- Delete users when no longer needed
- View user details by clicking on any user item

#### Teams
- Create teams and manage membership
- Add/remove users from teams
- Organize access control and permissions

#### Jobs
- Create and configure jobs using `.job.naos` files
- Run jobs directly from the Jobs view
- Monitor job execution with real-time task messages
- Abort running jobs if needed

#### Instances
- Provision and manage NAOS instances
- Configure instance parameters
- Monitor instance status and health

### VS Code Tasks Integration

Create VS Code tasks for NAOS jobs:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "naos-job",
            "jobId": "your-job-id-here",
            "priority": 5,
            "label": "Run NAOS Job",
            "group": "build"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuration

|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `naos.messages.minloglevel` | Minimum log level for task messages | `20` | `0-50` |

### Authentication

For deployments requiring authentication, include credentials in the gateway URL:
```
http://username:password@your-naos-host:9090/v1/
```

### Network Configuration
